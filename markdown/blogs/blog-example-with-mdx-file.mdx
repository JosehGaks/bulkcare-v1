Active listening is a crucial skill in customer support that involves fully concentrating, understanding, responding, and remembering what the customer is saying. It helps in building trust and improving customer satisfaction.

## Benefits of Active Listening:

1. **Improved Customer Satisfaction:** By actively listening, support agents can understand the customer's issue better and provide more accurate solutions.
